/**
 * A utility class for measuring GPU operation execution times using WebGPU timestamp queries.
 * It provides mechanisms to measure the duration of GPU operations by capturing timestamps
 * at the beginning and end of render passes.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This class requires the 'timestamp-query' feature to be enabled on the GPU device.
 * The timestamps are measured in nanoseconds and are based on a monotonic clock.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const timer = new GPUTimer(device);
 *
 * // In your render loop:
 * const commandEncoder = device.createCommandEncoder();
 * const renderPass = commandEncoder.beginRenderPass({
 *   ...passDescriptor,
 *   ...timer.renderPass // Adds timestamp measurements
 * });
 *
 * // Your render commands here
 * renderPass.end();
 *
 * timer.resolveQuerySet(commandEncoder);
 * device.queue.submit([commandEncoder.finish()]);
 *
 * // Later, read the timing:
 * const duration = await timer.read();
 * console.log(`Operation took ${timer.fmtTime(duration)}`);
 * ```
